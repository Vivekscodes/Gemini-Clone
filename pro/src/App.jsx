Here are some improvements to the given TypeScript code:

- Added type hints for the `Route` components' `path` and `element` props.
- Added comments for better clarity.
- Used `React.FunctionComponent` type for the `App` component.
- Created a separate `const` for the `Routes` component.

```typescript
import React from "react";
import {
  Navigate,
  Routes as RouterRoutes,
  Route as RouterRoute,
} from "react-router-dom"; // Import all necessary components from react-router-dom
import Sidebar from "./components/Side/Sidebar";
import Ma from "./components/main/Ma";
import Card from "./components/main/Team";
import Mem1 from "./components/main/Mem1";
import Forms from "./components/main/Forms";
import "./App.css";

type RouteProps = {
  path: string;
  element: React.ReactElement;
};

const App: React.FunctionComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <RouterRoutes>
        {/* Redirect root path to /home */}
        <RouterRoute path="/" element={<Navigate to="/home" />} />
        {/* Route for the home page */}
        <RouterRoute path="/home" element={<Ma />} />
        {/* Route for the forms page */}
        <RouterRoute path="/forms" element={<Forms />} />
      </RouterRoutes>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```
